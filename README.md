## Contributing
all contributions welcome. I am particularly struggling with the TypeError e.split it throws randomly. I got it to go away once and it ran perfectly, but when I pushed and pulled code it came back and my fixes don't resolve it anymore. All input is welcome!

## Tests
Feel free to test this as you see fit. I've already encoutered errors as previously mentioned. There are probably more out there.

## Questions
